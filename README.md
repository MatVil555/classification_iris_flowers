# classification_iris_flowers
A simple classification analysis, based on Gauss Naive Bayes, of 3 varieties of iris flowers, based on their sepal and petal structures. 
The dataset is first observed with K-means clustering.
The classification model is trained and tested using a 80-20 split.
Then the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and confusion table.
